## About
> "Say goodbye to complex cable networks - all you need are network cards to seamlessly link storage blocks for a unified storage system, with the ability to label storage grids using blocks like item frames, offering a unique and organized touch to your storage system"

This mod aims to be as simple as it could be, and also helping to keep your chest/any other storage block aesthetics in your world!

## Features
- Easy to learn - Just use a network card & link up all your storages!
- Decorate each Storage Controller with your own blocks/items.
- Ability to link with any storage blocks (even furnaces)
- Crafting Grid (saves when you exit the GUI)
