## About
> "Say goodbye to complex cable networks - all you need are network cards to seamlessly link storage blocks for a unified storage system, with the ability to label storage grids using blocks like item frames, offering a unique and organized touch to your storage system"

This mod aims to be as simple as it could be, and also helping to keep your chest/any other storage block aesthetics in your world!

_* This mod is inspired by Applied Energistics 2 & Refined Storage. However, I felt that players new to Minecraft Mods might not understand such an intricate system at the get-go. So, this mod is targeted mainly for early game setups, where you might not have enough understanding (for new players) to setup other mods' intricate storage systems._

## Features
- Easy to learn - Just use a network card & link up all your storages!
- Decorate each Storage Controller with your own blocks/items
- Ability to link with any storage blocks (even furnaces/other mod storages)
- Crafting Grid (saves when you exit the GUI) - w/ a smart algorithm to use up items in your Storage Network first as you craft
- Wireless - You can use your storage anywhere with a wireless controller!
- Intensive Search - You can use & combine prefixes to search for specific items (e.g., @modname storage or @modname #ores or just #ores)
- Smart Insert Algorithm - When inserting blocks into the Storage Network, it looks for pre-existing stacks to populate before using a new item slot.Â 
- Inter-dimension Support - Easily link storages that are in another dimension (should work with modded dimensions as well)
- JEI Integration - Easily transfer recipes using JEI, if a recipe accepts many kind of wood, it'll match the items in your inventory/Storage Network and populate accordingly.
- Comes in 16 different dyeable colors
- Server Ready - All item insertion & extraction is confirmed on the server, thus, no duplications can be made. Server-Client sync is also implemented well.
